## Build Your Own

Bazzite is built entirely in GitHub and creating your own custom version of it is as easy as forking this repository, adding a private signing key, and enabling GitHub actions.

[Familiarize yourself](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) on keeping secrets in github. You'll need to [generate a new keypair](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with cosign. The public key can be in your public repo <sub><sup>(Your users need it to check the signatures)</sup></sub>, and you can paste the private key in `Settings -> Secrets -> Actions` with the name `SIGNING_SECRET`.

We also ship a config for the popular [pull app](https://github.com/apps/pull) if you'd like to keep your fork in sync with upstream. Enable this app on your repo to keep track of Bazzite changes while also making your own modifications.
