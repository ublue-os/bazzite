## About & Features

Bazzite is an OCI image that serves as an alternative operating system for the [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/), and a ready-to-game SteamOS-like for desktop computers and living room home theater PCs. 

Bazzite is built from [ublue-os/main](https://github.com/ublue-os/main) and [ublue-os/nvidia](https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia) using [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/) technology, which means expanded hardware support and built in drivers are included. Additionally, Bazzite adds the following features: 

- Proprietary Nvidia drivers pre-installed.
- Full hardware accelerated codec support for H264 decoding.
- Full support for AMD's ROCM OpenCL/HIP runtimes.
- Includes Valve's KDE themes from SteamOS.
- [LatencyFleX](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX), [vkBasalt](https://github.com/DadSchoorse/vkBasalt), [MangoHud](https://github.com/flightlessmango/Mangohud), and [OBS VkCapture](https://github.com/nowrep/obs-vkcapture) installed and available by default
- Support for [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en) on KDE.
- [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) preinstalled with automatic updates for created containers.
- Automated duperemove services for reducing the disk space used by wine prefix contents.
- [System76-Scheduler](https://github.com/pop-os/system76-scheduler) preinstalled, providing automatic process priority tweaks to your focused application and keeping CPU time for background processes to a minimum.
- Customized System76-Scheduler config with additional rules and CFS parameters from [Linux-TKG](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg).
- Uses [Google's BBR TCP congestion control](https://github.com/google/bbr) by default.
- [Input Remapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/input-remapper) preinstalled and enabled (Available but default-disabled on the Deck variant)
- Helpful first-start installer provides an easy way to install numerous applications and tweaks, including installing [CoreCtrl](https://gitlab.com/corectrl/corectrl) and [GreenWithEnvy](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe).
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager optionally available.
- [OpenRGB](https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB) i2c-piix4 and i2c-nct6775 drivers for controlling RGB on certain motherboards.
- [GCAdapter_OC](https://github.com/hannesmann/gcadapter-oc-kmod) driver for overclocking Nintendo's Gamecube Controller Adapter to 1000hz polling.

### Desktop

Common variant available as `bazzite` and suitable for desktops and HTPCs.

- Runs Steam and Lutris in a [custom Arch Linux OCI](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite-arch/) via Distrobox.
- Option to automatically launch Steam in Big Picture Mode on boot for HTPCs.

To rebase an existing ostree system to this image: 

    podman pull ghcr.io/ublue-os/config && rpm-ostree install --assumeyes --apply-live --force-replacefiles $(find ~/.local/share/containers -name ublue-os-signing.noarch.rpm 2>/dev/null) && rpm-ostree rebase --uninstall $(rpm -q ublue-os-signing-* --queryformat '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{Arch}') ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite:latest

or for devices with Nvidia GPUs:

    podman pull ghcr.io/ublue-os/config && rpm-ostree install --assumeyes --apply-live --force-replacefiles $(find ~/.local/share/containers -name ublue-os-signing.noarch.rpm 2>/dev/null) && rpm-ostree rebase --uninstall $(rpm -q ublue-os-signing-* --queryformat '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{Arch}') ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-nvidia:latest

Once you've installed or rebased to a Nvidia build, [be sure to follow steps 2 and 3 from the ublue-os/nvidia guide](https://github.com/ublue-os/nvidia#2-set-kargs-after-rebasing).

### Deck

Variant designed for usage as an alternative to SteamOS on the Steam Deck, available as `bazzite-deck`:

- Directly boots to Gamemode matching SteamOS's behavior.
- Features ported versions of most SteamOS packages, including drivers, firmware updaters, and fan controllers [from the evlaV repository](https://gitlab.com/evlaV).
- Patched Mesa for proper framerate control from Gamescope.
- Comes with patches from [SteamOS BTRFS](https://gitlab.com/popsulfr/steamos-btrfs) for full BTRFS support for the SD card by default.
- Ships with a ported copy of [SDGyroDSU](https://github.com/kmicki/SteamDeckGyroDSU), enabled by default.
- Option to install [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader), [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/), and [ProtonUp-Qt](https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/), among numerous other useful packages on installation.
- Custom update system allows for the OS, Flatpaks, and Distrobox images to be updated directly from the Gamemode UI.
- Built in support for dual-boot thanks to Fedora's installation of GRUB being left intact.
- Update break something? Easily roll back to the previous version of Bazzite thanks to rpm-ostree's rollback functionality. You can even select previous images at boot.
- Steam and Lutris preinstalled on the image as layered packages.
- Comes with a default-disabled service for low-risk undervolting of the Steam Deck via [RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj).
- Exclusively uses ZRAM by default with the option to switch back to a swap file and set a custom size if desired (1GB by default).
- BFQ I/O scheduler to prevent I/O starvation when installing games or during background duperemove processes.
- TLS/SSL secured DNS and NTP by default <sup><sub>(This is a handheld PC you're likely to use on random public networks after all)</sub></sup>.
- Applies SteamOS's kernel parameters and enables amd-pstate by default.

To rebase an existing ostree system to this image: 

    podman pull ghcr.io/ublue-os/config && rpm-ostree install --assumeyes --apply-live --force-replacefiles $(find ~/.local/share/containers -name ublue-os-signing.noarch.rpm 2>/dev/null) && rpm-ostree rebase --uninstall $(rpm -q ublue-os-signing-* --queryformat '%{NAME}-%{VERSION}-%{RELEASE}.%{Arch}') ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/ublue-os/bazzite-deck:latest

## Why

Bazzite started as a project to resolve some of the issues that plague SteamOS, mainly out of date packages despite an Arch base and the lack of a functional package manager.

Despite this project also being image-based you are able to install any Fedora package straight from the command line. These packages will persist across updates <sub><sup>(So go ahead and install that obscure VPN software you spent an hour trying to get working in SteamOS)</sup></sub>. Additionally, Bazzite is updated daily with packages from upstream Fedora giving you the best possible performance and latest features - all on a stable base.

Bazzite ships with the latest Linux kernel and SELinux enabled by default with full support for secure boot and disk encryption, making this a sensible solution for general computing <sup><sub>(Yes, you can print from Bazzite)</sub></sup>.
