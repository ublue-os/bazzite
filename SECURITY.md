This is a volunteer-run project and is mostly creating images from existing Fedora packages. # TODO: Fedora-specific - remove or replace
If you've found an issue with something in one of these repositories you'd need to see if that package
comes from Fedora or from a third party resource and report the issue there. # TODO: Fedora-specific - remove or replace
The images build every day and automatically slipstream the changes from Fedora into the final image. # TODO: Fedora-specific - remove or replace
