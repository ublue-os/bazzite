# This sets defaults for Wi-Fi profiles to set a generated, stable MAC address.
#
# Do not modify this file. You can hide/overwrite this file by placing a file
# to "/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/22-wifi-mac-addr.conf". You can also add
# configuration snippets with higher priority that override this setting (see
# `man 5 NetworkManager.conf`). Most importantly, this snippet only sets
# default values for the profile. You can explicitly set the value for each
# profile, so that this default value is not used.
#
# For example, on a particular profile/network set
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" wifi.cloned-mac-address permanent
#
# to use the hardware MAC address. This prevents the default from this file
# to take effect.
#
# Or
#
#   $ nmcli connection modify "$PROFILE" wifi.cloned-mac-address stable connection.stable-id '${NETWORK_SSID}/${BOOT}'
#
# to get a generated MAC address that changes on each boot. Note how setting
# "connection.stable-id" also affects other aspects of the profile.
#
# See `man 5 nm-settings` for "wifi.cloned-mac-address" and "connection.stable-id".
