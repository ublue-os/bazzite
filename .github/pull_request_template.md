## Thank you for contributing to the Universal Blue project!

Please [read the Contributor's Guide](https://universal-blue.org/contributing.html) before submitting a pull request.

In this project we follow [Semantic PRs][1] and [Conventional Commits][2] to describe features and fixes we made. It would be nice if you did too as we use this to generate changelogs with the right sections: 

    feat(deck): enable this deck specific feature
    fix(ally): fix screen rotation on the ally
    feat(gnome): Stuff that is GNOME specific

If you're unsure a generic `feat:` or `fix:` is fine! Did you already use this? Awesome, thanks again! Not sure what this all means? Here are some [more examples][3].
