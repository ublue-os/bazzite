  # Extest is a drop in replacement for the X11 XTEST extension.
  # It creates a virtual device with the uinput kernel module.
  # It's been primarily developed for allowing the desktop functionality
  # on the Steam Controller to work while Steam is open on Wayland.
  # Also supports Steam Input as a whole.
