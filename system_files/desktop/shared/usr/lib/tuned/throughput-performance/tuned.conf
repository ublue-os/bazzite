# The default unit for readahead is KiB.  This can be adjusted to sectors
# by specifying the relevant suffix, eg. (readahead => 8192 s). There must

# PID allocation wrap value.  When the kernel's next PID value
# reaches this value, it wraps back to a minimum PID value.
# PIDs of value pid_max or larger are not allocated.
#
# A suggested value for pid_max is 1024 * <# of cpu cores/threads in system>
# e.g., a box with 32 cpus, the default of 32768 is reasonable, for 64 cpus,
# 65536, for 4096 cpus, 4194304 (which is the upper limit possible).

# The swappiness parameter controls the tendency of the kernel to move
# processes out of physical memory and onto the swap disk.
# 0 tells the kernel to avoid swapping processes out of physical memory

# 100 tells the kernel to aggressively swap processes out of physical memory
# and move them to swap cache
