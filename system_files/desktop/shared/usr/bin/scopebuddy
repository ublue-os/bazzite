# Special thanks to @coolavery for the initial script for this
# https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope/issues/835#issuecomment-2496383830
#
# Purpose of this script:
# * Allow launching gamescope with a default set of environment variables and gamescope args set by the user
#   "~/.config/scopebuddy/scb.conf" will be created with examples after first run
# * Serve as a temporary workaround for fixing the steam overlay when using nested gamescope on desktop steam until fixed upstream
