It is **always** better to install packages with Distrobox rather than layer them with rpm-ostree. `ujust distrobox` makes it easy! - [More about supported packages](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=35)
Packages installed in Distrobox can be exported to appear like any other application - [View documentation](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/usage/distrobox-export.md).
*Update break something?* You can roll back and pin the previous release or rebase by build date - [View our guide](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=36).
*This isn't a distro*, this is a custom image built on  Fedora technology - [View our mission](https://universal-blue.org/mission/)
