It is **always** better to install packages with Distrobox rather than layer them with rpm-ostree. `ujust distrobox` makes it easy!~[More info](https://docs.bazzite.gg/Installing_and_Managing_Software/Distrobox/)
Packages installed in Distrobox can be exported to appear like any other application~[View documentation](https://distrobox.it/usage/distrobox-export/)
*Update break something?* You can roll back and pin the previous release or rebase by build date~[View our guide](https://docs.bazzite.gg/Installing_and_Managing_Software/Updates_Rollbacks_and_Rebasing/rolling_back_system_updates/)
*This isn't a distro*, this is a custom image built on  Fedora Atomic Desktop technology~[View our mission](https://ublue.it/mission/)
