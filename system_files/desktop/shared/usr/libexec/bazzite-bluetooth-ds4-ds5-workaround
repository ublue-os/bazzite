#
# Description:
# This script monitors connected PS4 and PS5 gamepad devices and disconnects
# the Bluetooth connection if specific button combinations are detected (Home and Triangle buttons).
# The script handles background processes for each device and maintains a record of process IDs
# to ensure proper cleanup of processes associated with devices that are no longer present.
#
# This script should be removed if there is a native solution under one of the mentioned issues.
#
# Usage:
# ./bazzite-bluetooth-ds4-ds5-workaround [-d]
# -d: Enable debug mode
