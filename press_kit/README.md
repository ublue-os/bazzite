# Press Kit

Thanks for generating content about about Bazzite and Universal Blue! This document will explain how to use the brand and terminology used by the project.

- [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg/)
- [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/)

# Bazzite Terminology
The name of the project is `Bazzite`. It is built with [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), which publishes base images that Bazzite uses. These in turn are derived from Fedoraâ€™s Atomic Desktop images. Universal Blue is the parent organization of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev), and [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore). It also acts as the GitHub organization. 

## Proper Usage
- `Bazzite` - used to refer to the project and/or operating system
- `Bazzite-Deck` - Image used for handhelds, HTPCs, and other systems that can make use of Steam Gaming Mode

## Incorrect Usage
- `Bazzite OS` - or any addition of "OS" to the name.
- `Fedora Bazzite` - this implies a formal relationship between Fedora and Bazzite. Check the [mission document](https://universal-blue.org/mission.html) for more information about the relationship between Fedora and Universal Blue
- `Universal Bazzite` or `uBlue Bazzite` - "Bazzite is built with Universal Blue" or "Bazzite is a Universal Blue image" is recommended instead.
- "Immutable Distribution" - Bazzite is an operating system, it is neither immutable nor a distribution, it is a custom image based on Fedora. As an alternative for immutable, the word `Atomic` may be used.


# Universal Blue Terminology

## Proper Usage

- `Universal Blue` - used to refer to the Universal Blue Project, the GitHub organization, or the collective set of maintainers

## Incorrect Usage

- `uBlue`, `UBlue`, `ublue-os`, or any contraction of the term. These shorthand names are commonly used as convenience slugs in URLs or paths in the operating system such as `/usr/share/ublue-os`
