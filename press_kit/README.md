# Bazzite Press Kit

# About
For information about Bazzite, it's background, features, and installation, take a look at our [Readme](https://bazzite.gg/).

# Important Note
Bazzite is not a Linux distribution in the traditional sense. It is an OCI image built from Fedora Silverblue or Kinoite using Universal Blue technology. Users may at any time rebase from our image to stock Fedora and back again without losing data.

Feel free to email [KyleGospo](mailto:kylegospo@bazzite.gg) or [EyeCantCU](mailto:eyecantcu@bazzite.gg) with any questions!
