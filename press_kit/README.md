# Bazzite Press Kit

# About
For information about Bazzite, it's background, features, and installation, take a look at our [Readme](https://bazzite.gg/).

# Important Note
Bazzite is not a Linux distribution in the traditional sense. It is an OCI image built from Fedora Silverblue or Kinoite using [Universal Blue technology](https://universal-blue.org/). Users may at any time rebase from our image to stock Fedora and back again without losing data.
