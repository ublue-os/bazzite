# Contributing to Bazzite mdBook documentation

## Introduction

This is a guide that will show you:

- How to write new documentation pages in mdBooks.
- How to transcribe documentation, from Discourse forums (https://universal-blue.discourse.group/) to mdBook pages.

## Brief explanation in how to work with mdBook

> _mdBook is a command line tool to create books with Markdown. It is ideal for creating product or API documentation, tutorials, course materials or anything that requires a clean, easily navigable and customizable presentation_
>
> Source ~ https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/

**TL;DR**: Its a fancy way tool that allows us to create a documentation website with basic [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).

The essential part that cant be missing in a mdBook is the `SUMMARY.md` file.

```md
<!-- Example of SUMMARY.md contents -->

# General

- [üìú Bazzite's README](Bazzite_README.md)
- [‚ùìÔ∏è FAQ](General/FAQ.md)
- [üìñ Installation Guide](General/Installation_Guide/index.md)
- [üìù Desktop Environment Tweaks](General/Desktop_Environment_Tweaks.md)
- [ü§ù Contributing to Bazzite](General/Contributing_to_Bazzite.md)
- [üé≤ Gaming](Gaming/index.md)
  - [Game Launchers](Gaming/Game_Launchers.md)

# Steam Gaming Mode / Handheld & HTPC Hardware

- [üì∫Ô∏è Steam Gaming Mode Overview](Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/Steam_Gaming_Mode/index.md)
  - [Change Physical Keyboard Layout for Steam Gaming Mode](Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/Change_Physical_Keyboard_Layout_for_Steam_Gaming_Mode.md)
```

`SUMMARY.md` acts not only as a nice looking table of contents, but as indexer as well.

**If a page is not listed in `SUMMARY.md`, it wont be included in the mdBook**\*

## Transcribe Discourse docs to mdBooks

Requirements:

- Markdown compatible code editor (ex.: Visual Studio Code)
- mdBook (can be installed with Homebrew\*)
- Git

<small>\* If you are using Bazzite or [similar](https://universal-blue.org/), chances are that you already have it installed.</small>

Best way to learn is with a real life example. We will transcribe https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=2743

### 1. Basic preparation

We will start with getting our utilities ready:

1. A web browser with the Discourse doc page we want to transcribe. We will use <https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=2743> for this example.
2. Our code editor.
3. A terminal open in the `docs` directory

   ```sh
   $ cd docs
   ```

   Get sure we have `fetch_discourse_md.py` in there, we will need it

   ```sh
   $ ls ./utils/fetch_discourse_md.py
   ./utils/fetch_discourse_md.py
   ```

### 2. Copy the post

`fetch_discourse_md.py` is your friend for this task.

1. Copy the URL of the document
2. In the terminal, pass the URL to `fetch_discourse_md.py`

   ```sh
   $ ./utils/fetch_discourse_md.py "https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=2743" | wl-copy
   ```

   Normally, `fetch_discourse_md.py` would dump the resulting markdown doc in the terminal output, with `wl-copy` we store it in our clipboard for now.

3. Create the markdown file where we will store our document. The title of the post is "_Dual Boot Preliminary Setup and Post-Setup Guide_", so somewhere under "Advanced" should be fitting.

   > Instead, use underscores `_`

### 4. Paste the document in the file

![](./src/img/doc_guide_paste.jpg)

### 5. Rewrite URLs

We are almost done. The problem is `fetch_discourse_md.py` only will give us a dumped version of the Discourse document.

There is posibly URLs that are pointing to other documentation posts in Discourse that we might have already in our mdBook.

![](./src/img/doc_guide_discourse_url.jpg)

The url in the image above is pointing to the _Steam Gaming Mode Overview (Handheld/HTPC)_ post.
At the time of writting this, we have that post avaliable in our mdBook, so we can simply replace that URL with ours

![](./src/img/doc_guide_rewrite_url.jpg)

In our case, the post is located in `../Handheld_and_HTPC_edition/Steam_Gaming_Mode/index.md`

### 6. Link back in `SUMMARY.md`

We can check how our post looks in mdBook, run in the terminal

```sh
mdbook serve --open
```

Now, more likely you wont find our new added post.

![](./src/img/doc_guide_where_did_go.jpg)

If you take a look at [the brief explanation](#brief-explanation-in-how-to-work-with-mdbook), you will read about `SUMMARY.md`. Files not listed in there wont be processed by mdBook.

Lets add our file there.

And now our post is ready.

## Translate documentation

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING
>
> It is better to start translation once [transcription](#transcribe-discourse-docs-to-mdbooks) is settled to keep up.

Translation isnt so straightforward as copying a markdown file and start working.

We rely in [mdbook-i18n-helpers](https://github.com/google/mdbook-i18n-helpers) for translation, which uses [GNU Gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html).

We need some more dependencies in order to do translations, which can be installed with this script:

```sh
bash docs/utils/install-deps.sh
```

<details>
<summary>
<big>Dependencies list</big><br>
<sup>Ignore if using install-deps.sh</sup>
</summary>

- `.po` file editor (like [Poedit](https://flathub.org/apps/net.poedit.Poedit))
- Rust's `cargo` (you can install rust by running
  `brew install rustup; rustup-init`)
- `mdbook-i18n-helpers` (after installing rust,
  `cargo install mdbook-i18n-helpers`)

</details>

### 1. Basic preparation

Move to `docs`, then build the `.pot` file

```sh
cd docs
just build_messages_pot
```

This will create `po/messages.pot`, which acts as an index of text fragments
from all our markdown files.

### 2. (Optional) Add a new language

All translations files are stored in `docs/po/` in the form of `xx.po` files, `xx` referencing the language code following [ISO 639][ISO]. Per example, `es.po` would be an Spanish translation
file.

To add a new language to the documentation, follows these steps:

1. Get sure you did the [basic preparation](#1-basic-preparation-1)
2. Then run this, replacing `XX` with the [language code][ISO]:

   ```sh
   just add_translation XX
   ```

   In my case, I'm going to create an Spanish translation file:

   ```sh
   just add_translation es
   ls po/
   # es.po  messages.pot
   ```

### 3. Working with a translation file

![Poedit](./src/img/poedit.jpg)

We will now open that `.po` file with our po editor (in my case is Poedit).

We make some changes, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save.

Lets see the changes we had done with a preview. Run this:

```sh
just preview_translation XX
```

In my case is `es`

```sh
just preview_translation es
```

And there it is!
