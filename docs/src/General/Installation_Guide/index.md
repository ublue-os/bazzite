# **Important Installation Notes**:

- Use a download manager if the direct download fails or is downloading too slow.

- A physical wired keyboard is **recommended**.

- Create a User Account with a **username** and a **user password** if you have a keyboard.

- Make sure to only select the appropriate drives to avoid losing data on others, and it is best practice to safely remove any external drives before proceeding.

- Secure Boot is supported on most hardware, but you must [**enroll our key**](./secure_boot.md).
