## Installation Guide

> The part of the guide that requires the most effort.

### 1. Download and Flash Bazzite

- Download [Bazzite](https://download.bazzite.gg) after choosing the correct ISO for your hardware with our Image Picker tool.
- Flash Bazzite to your bootable medium.
- Eject drive.

#### Current Fedora Atomic Desktop Users

Current [Fedora Atomic Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/) users can rebase with the terminal command listed on the website under the "Existing Fedora Atomic Desktop Users" section and can skip the next step.

### 2. Boot Bazzite

- Connect your bootable medium to your device and boot into it.
- After connecting the device, boot into the Bazzite installer.
- This depends on your motherboard hardware, but most of the time it could be a function keys like <kbd>F9</kbd> or similar.
  - Sometimes you need to consult the manual, look up your device online, or read any hotkeys that appear when you boot your PC.
    - Alternatively change the BIOS settings to boot with your bootable device first before your current storage, but this is **not recommended** to keep enabled after installing Bazzite.
- Verify the media correctly and proceed to the installer.

### Dual Boot Preliminary Setup + Post-Setup Guide

Read the [Dual Boot Guide](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/docs?topic=2743) **after** reading this guide before proceeding.

## Post-Installation

> The fine tuning before gaming.

### GRUB Menu

![Rollbacks|690x402, 50%](../../img/GRUB_Menu.png)

The first boot will show a screen showing your current and last deployment. It will automatically boot if nothing. It is important to note that the GRUB menu can be used to rollback Bazzite deployments if you encounter issues.

Read more about this in the [Updates, Rollback, and Rebasing documentation](../../Installing_and_Managing_Software/Updates_Rollbacks_and_Rebasing/index.md).

### Configuring System Settings for KDE Plasma and GNOME

**_KDE Plasma's System Settings application_**

![Display Settings (GNOME)|690x344, 75%](../../img/GNOME_Display_Settings.png)
**_GNOME's Settings application_**

It is important to configure the system settings on a first boot to personalize your desktop especially if you notice the scaling is incorrect on first-boot.

### First Boot Setup Utility: Bazzite Portal

![Welcome to Bazzite|618x500, 75%](../../img/yafti_welcome.jpeg)

**Attention**: Make sure you are connected to the internet.

An application will pop up welcoming you to Bazzite when you boot into the desktop for the first time. This is a utility that allows you to tailor Bazzite to your liking by installing additional software.

![Bazzite Portal|584x500, 75%](../../img/yafti_options.png)

- Click "Next" to begin configuring Bazzite.
- Press the toggle switch button next to the item to have the option enabled or disabled for your installation, some are already toggled on by default.
- If you would like to customize any of the options, then press the arrow next to the toggle switch button if available.
- Installing items from the portal **may take a long time**.

> **Note**: If you only check a few items in a category, then it will only install those selected items. The switch is only toggled to install **everything** in that category.

> **Attention**: There is a rare chance you will be asked to setup KDE Wallet or GNOME Keyring and set a password to continue installing items from the Bazzite Portal.

### Installing additional software

The [Installing and Managing Applications documentation](../../Installing_and_Managing_Software/index.md) is useful to learn how to install additional software on Bazzite outside of the Bazzite Portal.

### Login to Steam & Reboot Device

Login to Steam then **reboot** your device when you finish setting up your device during the first-boot process.

#### Setup Steam Gaming Mode

![Steam Gaming Mode Setup|690x442, 50%](../../img/pLvHB1NAMlb3ghsR72q7l9Auj8B.jpeg)

After completing all of the above, then your next boot will be in Steam Gaming Mode which requires additional setup for Steam.
