# Linux Package Formats

> **Package formats ranked from most recommended for daily usage**:
>
> 1. [Flatpak](./Flatpak.md) - Universal package format using a permissions-based model; use for most graphical applications.
> 2. [`ujust`](./ujust.md) - Custom scripts maintained by Bazzite & Universal Blue contributors that can install applications.
> 3. [Homebrew](./Homebrew.md) - Install applications intended to run inside of the terminal (CLI/TUI).
> 4. [Distrobox](./Distrobox.md) - Intended for legacy applications that do not support Flatpak and Homebrew, or for use as development boxes.
> 5. [AppImage](./AppImage.md) - Portable universal package format that relies on specific host libraries at a system-level, usually obtained from a project's website.
> 6. [`rpm-ostree`](./rpm-ostree.md) - Layer Fedora packages at a system-level (**not recommended, use as a last resort**)

# How do I run Windows applications?

> **Use a [WINE](https://www.winehq.org/) front-end**:
>
> - [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) (_pre-installed_) has a Windows compatibility layer built-in.
> - [Lutris](https://lutris.net/about) (_pre-installed_) for non-Steam video games.
> - [Heroic](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/) for Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon Games integration.
> - [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/) for general-purpose applications or as an alternative to Lutris.
> - [itch](https://flathub.org/apps/io.itch.itch) for games on itch.io.
> - [WineZGUI](https://github.com/fastrizwaan/WineZGUI) (_pre-installed_) for Windows applications that donâ€™t require special considerations for their prefix.

# How do I install Android applications?

Follow the [Waydroid Setup Guide](./Waydroid_Setup_Guide.md) to install Android applications on Bazzite.
