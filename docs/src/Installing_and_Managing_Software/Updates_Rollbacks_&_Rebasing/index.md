# Updates

Updates are automatic on Desktop images and manually done on Handheld/HTPC images, and both Bazzite variants upgrade everything at both a system-level and user-installed applications during the updating process.

# Rollbacks

Swap back to a previous system update if there are major issues after updating via the GRUB menu or the `rpm-ostree rollback` command.

# Rebasing

>**Important**: Do **not** rebase to a different desktop environment than the one you are currently using, please backup and reinstall instead.

Rebase to Bazzite builds from the last 90 days, change Bazzite update channels, swap between the Desktop and Handheld/HTPC images, or move completely to a different Fedora Atomic Desktop image.
